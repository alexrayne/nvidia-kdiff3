 Features</h2>
    
<h3> Line-By-Line And Char-By-Char Diff-Viewer</h3>
  By using the possiblities of a graphical color display KDiff3 shows exactly
 what the difference is: <br>
 <img src="letter_by_letter.png" height="63" width="490">
  <br>
 &nbsp;  
<h3> See White-Space Differences At One Glance</h3>
  Spaces and tabs that differ appear visibly. When lines differ only in the
 amount of white space this can be seen at one&nbsp; look in the summary
column on the left side. <br>
 <img src="white_space.png" height="60" width="480">
  <br>
 &nbsp;  
<h3> Triple-Diff</h3>
  Analyze three files and see where they differ. <br>
 The left/middle/right windows are named A/B/C and have the blue/green/magenta
 color respectively. <br>
 If one file is the same and one file is different on a line then the color 
shows which file is different. The red color means that both other files are
different. <br>

  <br>
 &nbsp;  
<h3> Comfortable Merge Of Two Or Three Input Files</h3>
  KDiff3 can be used to merge two or three input files and automatically
merges as much as possible. The result is presented in an editable window
where most conflicts can be solved with a single mouseclick: Select the buttons 
A/B/C from the button-bar to select the source that should be used. You can 
also select more than one source. Since this output window is an editor even 
conflicts which need further corrections can be solved here without requiring 
another tool. <br>
 &nbsp;  
<h3> And ...</h3>
    
<ul>
  <li> Fast navigation via buttons.</li>
   <li>A&nbsp;mouse-click into a summary column sync's all windows to show 
the same position.</li>
   <li> Select and copy from any window and paste into the merge result window.</li>
   <li> Overview column that shows where the changes and conflicts are.</li>
   <li> The colors are adjustable to your specific preferences.</li>
   <li> Adjustable Tab size.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>Option to insert spaces instead of tabs.</li>
   <li> Open files comfortably via dialog or specify files on the command 
line.</li>
   <li> ...</li>
   
</ul>
    
<h3> Diff Algorithm</h3>
  Some graphical diff-tools are just front-ends to the good old command-line
 Diff. This is reuse at its best but also limits the possiblities of any
front-end because a diff-analysis of each line is not provided by Diff.  
<p>I invented my own diff-algorithm, with the advantage that I could also
 reuse it for a line comparison. This algorithm was optimized for use with
 C/C++-source files. I hope that the results are useful for you. <br>

<h3> Open-Dialog</h3>
  Since many input files must be selectable, the program has a special open
 dialog: <br>
 <img src="open_dialog.png" height="189" width="448">
  <br>
 The open dialog allows to edit the filenames by hand, selecting a file via 
the file-browser ("Select...") or allows to choose recent files from the drop-down
lists. If you open the dialog again, then the current names still remain
there. The third &nbsp;input file is not required. If the entry for "C" remains
empty, then only a two file diff analysis will be done.  
<p>If "Merge" is selected, then the "Output"-line becomes editable. But it 
is not required to specify the output filename immediately. You can also postpone
this until saving. </p>
 
<p>The "Configure"-button opens the options-dialog, so that you can set the 
options before running the analysis. <br>
 &nbsp; </p>
 
<h3> Interpreting The Information In The Input Windows</h3>
 At the top of each text window is its "info line". The info lines of the 
input windows contain a letter "A", "B" or "C", the filename and the line 
number of the first visible line in the window. (Note that window "C" is optional.)
Each info line appears in a different color. <br>
 The three input windows are assigned the letters "A", "B" and "C". "A" has 
color blue, "B" has green and "C" has magenta. (These are the defaults, but 
can be changed in the Settings-Menu.) <br>
 When a difference is detected then the color shows which input file differs. 
When both other input files differ then the color used to express this is 
red by default ("Conflict color" in the Settings).  
<p>Left of each text is the "summary column". If differences occurred on
a line then the summary column shows the respective color. For a white-space-only
 difference the summary is chequered. For programming languages where white
 space is not so important this is useful to see at one glance if anything
 of importance was modified. (In C/C++ white space is only interesting within
 strings, comments, for the preprocessor, and some only very esoteric situations.)
 <br>
 The vertical line separating the summary column and the text is interrupted
 if the input file had no lines there. </p>
 
<p>On the right side a "overview"-column is visible left of the vertical
scrollbar. It shows the compressed summary column of input "A". All the differences 
and conflicts are visible at one glance. When only two input windows are used,
then all differences appear red here because every difference is also a conflict.
A black rectangle frames the visible part of the inputs. For very long input
files, when the number of input lines is bigger than the height of the overview
column in pixels, then several input lines share one overview line. A conflict
then has top priority over simple differences, which have priority over no
change, so that no difference or conflict is lost here.  By clicking into
this overview column the corresponding text will be shown.<br>
 &nbsp; </p>
 
<h3> Merging And The Merge Output Editor Window</h3>
  This window also has an info line at the top showing "Output:", the filename
 and "[Modified]" if you edited something. Usually it will contain some text 
through the automatic merge facilities, but often it will also contain conflicts.
 
<p>!!! Saving is disabled until all conflicts are resolved !!! </p>
 
<p>With only two input files every difference is also a conflict that must
 be solved manually. <br>
 With three input files the first file is treated as base, while the second 
and third input files contain modifications. When at any line only either 
input B or input C have changed but not both then the changed source will 
automatically be selected. Only when B and C have changed on the same lines, 
then the tool detects a conflict that must be solved manually. </p>
 
<p>The merge output editor window also has a summary column. It shows the
 letter of the input from which a line was selected or nothing if all three
 sources where equal on a line. For conflicts it shows a questionmark "?"
and the line shows "&lt;Merge Conflict&gt;", all in red. Because solving
conflicts  line by line would take very long, the lines are grouped into
groups that  have the same difference and conflict characteristics. When
clicking into  the summary column with the left mouse button in either window
then the group belonging to that line will be selected in all windows and
the beginning of that group will be shown. (This might involve an automatic
position jump in the windows if the beginning of a group is not visible.)
<br>
 Note the input selector buttons containing the letters "A", "B" and "C"
in the button bar below the menu bar. When clicking on either input selector 
button, the lines from that input will be added at the end of the selected 
group if that group didn't contain that source before. Otherwise the lines 
from that input will be removed. </p>
 
<p>Besides, you can directly edit any line. The summary column will show
"m" for every line that was modified . </p>
 
<p>Sometimes, when a line is removed either by automatic merge or be editing
 and no other lines remain in that group, then the text &lt;No src line&gt;
 will appear in that line. This is just a placeholder for the group for when 
you might change your mind and select some source again. This text won't appear
in the saved file or in any selections you want to copy and paste.  </p>
 
<p>The text "&lt;Merge Conflict&gt;" will not appear either if you copy and
 paste some text containing that line. Be careful to do so! </p>
 
<h3> Navigation And Editing</h3>
  Much navigation will be done with the scroll bars and the mouse but you
can also navigate with the keys. If you click into either window then you
can use the cursor buttons left, right, up, down, page up, page down, home,
end, ctrl-home, ctrl-end as you would in other programs. The overview-column
next to the &nbsp;vertical scroll bar of the input files can also be used
for navigating by clicking into it.  
<p>In the merge output editor you can also use the other keys for editing.
 You can toggle between insert and overwrite mode with the insert key. (Default
 is insert-mode.) </p>
 
<p>A left-mouse-button-click into any summary column will synchronise all
 windows to show the beginning of the same group of lines (as explained above, 
see Merging). </p>
 
<p>The button bar also contains six navigation buttons with which you can
 jump to the first/last group of lines, to the next/previous difference group 
or to the next/previous conflict. </p>
 
<h3> Select, Copy And Paste</h3>
  The input windows don't show a cursor, so selections must be made with
the mouse by clicking with the left mouse button at the start, holding down
the mousebutton and moving to the end, where you release the mouse button
again. You can also select a word by double clicking it. In the merge output
editor you can also select via the keyboard by holding the "shift"-button
and navigation with the cursor keys.  
<p>To copy to the clipboard you must press the "Copy"-button or Ctrl-C. But 
there exists an option "Auto Copy Selection". If this is enabled, then whatever 
you select is copied immediately and you don't need to explicitely copy. But
pay attention when using this because the contents of the clipboard might 
then be destroyed accidentally. </p>
 
<p>"Cut" (Ctrl-X) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text and 
"Paste" (Ctrl-V) inserts the text in the clipboard at the cursorposition
or over the current selection. </p>
 
<h3> Options</h3>
  Options and the recent-file-list will be saved when you exit the program,
 and reloaded when you start it.  
<h4> Font</h4>
  Select a fixed width font. (On some systems this dialog will also present
 variable width fonts, but you should not use them.)  
<h4> Colors</h4>
  Foreground color: Usually black. <br>
 Background color: Usually white. <br>
 Diff Background color: Usually light gray. <br>
 Color A: Usually dark blue. <br>
 Color B: Usually dark green. <br>
 Color C: Usually dark magenta. <br>
 Conflict Color: Usually red.  
<h4> Editor Settings</h4>
  Tab inserts spaces: If this is disabled and you press the tabulator key,
 a tab-character is inserted, otherwise the appropriate amount of characters
 is inserted. <br>
 Tab size: Can be adjusted for your specific needs. Default is 8. <br>
 Auto indentation: When pressing Enter or Return the indentation of the previous 
line is used for the new line. <br>
 Auto copy selection: Every selection is immediately copied to the clipboard
 when active and you needn't explicitely copy it.  
<h4> Diff Settings</h4>
  Ignore white space: Default is on. White space will be ignored in the first
 part of the analysis in which the line matching is done. In the result the 
white space differences will be shown nevertheless. <br>
 Ignore trivial matches: Default is on. When trivial lines match after an 
difference, this will be ignored and the search for a nontrivial matching 
line continues. This improves the results for inputs with empty lines and 
lines containing only a open or close-brace character, which is often the 
case for C/C++-programs. <br>

 Questions And Answers</h2>
    
<h4> Why is it called KDiff3?</h4>
  Tools named KDiff and KDiff2 already exist. Also "KDiff3" should suggest
 that it can merge like the "diff3"-tool in the Diff-Tool collection.  
<h4> Why did I release it under GPL?</h4>
  I'm using GPL programs for a very long time now and learned very much by
 having a look at many of the sources. Hence this is my "Thank You" to all
 programmers that also did so or will do the same.  
<h4> Often lines that are similar but not identical appear next to each other
 but sometimes not. Why?</h4>
  Lines where only the amount of white space characters is different are
treated as "equal" at first, while just one different non-white character
causes the lines to be "different". If similar lines appear next to each
other, this actually is coincidence but this fortunately is often the case.
 
<h4> Sometimes lines that are identical don't appear next to each other. Why?</h4>
  Lines that contain very few (less than three) non-white characters are
not used for a match after a difference. Also solitary matching lines in
the middle of differences are not used for matching if they are too far apart. 
Most of the time this behaviour improves the quality of the diff-analysis.
 But if users (that includes you!) tell me that they need a different behaviour,
 then I'll make this an option in the next version.  
<h4> Why won't the merge tool automatically merge if both changes are equal?</h4>
  Previously I also thought this would be nice, but when I tried it, I saw
 that this is dangerous. Sometimes by coincindence two changes are identical
 in certain lines but not otherwise. When this is merged automatically then
 these lines that are actually needed twice - once for each change - only
appear once in the merge result. It can even happen that no other conflict
appears in the vicinity and then the problem goes completely unnoticed.  
<h4> Why must all conflicts be solved before the merge result can be saved?</h4>
  For each equal or different section the editor in the merge result window
 remembers where it begins or ends. This is needed so that conflicts can
be solved manually by simply selecting the source button (A, B or C). This
information is lost while saving as text and it is too much effort to create
a special file format that supports saving and restoring all necessary information.
 
<h4> Why does the editor in the merge result window not have an "undo"-function?</h4>
  This was too much effort to do in the first version. And you can always
restore a version from one source (A, B or C) by clicking the respective
button. For big editing the use of another editor is recommended anyway.
 
<h4> When I removed some text, then suddenly "&lt;No src line&gt;" appeared 
and can't be deleted. What does that mean and how can one remove this?</h4>
  For each equal or different section the editor in the merge result window
 remembers where it begins or ends.&nbsp; "&lt;No src line&gt;" means that
 there is nothing left in a section, not even a new line character. This
can happen either while merging automatically or by editing. This is no problem, 
since this hint won't appear in the saved file. If you want the orignal source 
back just select the section (click on the left summary column) and then click
the source button with the needed contents (A/B or C).  
<h4> Why doesn't KDiff3 support syntax-highlighting?</h4>
  KDiff3 already uses many colors for difference highlighting. More highlighting
 would be confusing. Use another editor for this. <br>
 
<h4>There is so much information here, but your question is still not answered?</h4>
 Please send me your question. I appreciate every comment.<br>
