README for the Documentation
============================
Author: Joachim Eibl, 2004-02-22

The following text contains some info about how the docs are created.
It helps me remember certain details. Most users probably aren't 
interested in these things.

Each directory contains the documentation for a different translation.
The textual information is in the index.docbook of every subdirectory.

I wrote the English version in en/index.docbook. The other translations
were done by the KDE-Internationalization-Team. They are doing a great
job!


The command meinproc (which is part of KDE) can be used to convert this 
file into HTML.

meinproc index.docbook

During normal installation on KDE a compressed file is generated.

meinproc --check --cache index.cache.bz2 index.docbook


As a service for non-KDE-users the en-directory also contains the 
HTML-version of the English documentation.

After running meinproc the HTML-files contain some references to files 
in help:/common/ which contains stylesheets and KDE-graphics which make
the result look much prettier. Because on non-KDE-systems this is not 
available, I placed a copy of these files in doc/en/common. 
To correct the references, I run the following command, which removes 
the "help:/"-part of the references, and only the "common/"-part remains.

for i in *.html; do sed -i "s/help:\///g" $i; done

(sed-option "-i" means in-place, "s/orig/repl/" is the replacement-command,
"g" replaces every occurance in the line, not only the first.)

The screenshots were made with the English KDE-version and therefore are
placed in the en-directory. But since for the other translations no new
screenshots were made yet, they only contain links to the English 
screenshots. These links are created en-bloc with this command. (But
first you must cd into each subdirectory.)

for i in `ls ../en | grep png`; do ln -s ../en/$i $i; done

Command to retrieve other translations from cvs:

cvs co kde-i18n/subdirs
for i in `cat kde-i18n/subdirs`; do  cvs co kde-i18n/$i/docs/kdeextragear-1/kdiff3/index.docbook; done
