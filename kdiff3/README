Requirements & Installation:
   Version 0.81 supports KDE2 and KDE3 but due to some problem with libkio and libkfile
   it was necessary to provide different packages for each, but only the configure
   script differs.

   For KDE2 you need
      - kdiff3-0.81_for_KDE2.tar.gz
      - KDE2 and QT2-libraries.
      - gcc, g++ with version >=2.95      
      
   For KDE3 you need
      - kdiff3-0.81_for_KDE3.tar.gz
      - KDE3 and QT3-libraries.
      - gcc, g++ with version >=2.95

Installation for KDE2:
   - Make sure your shell-variable QTDIR is correct. (echo $QTDIR).
     If it doesn't contain the correct path, type
        export QTDIR=your_path_to_qt  (e.g. /usr/lib/qt2)
   - Unpack the archive: tar xvfz kdiff3-0.81_for_KDE2.tar.gz
   - cd into the directory kdiff3-0.81 and type
   - ./configure --prefix=/opt/kde2
   - make
   - make install  (You must have root-rights for this step.)

Installation for KDE3:
   - Make sure your shell-variable QTDIR is correct. (echo $QTDIR).
     If it doesn't contain the correct path, type
        export QTDIR=your_path_to_qt  (e.g. /usr/lib/qt3)
   - Unpack the archive: tar xvfz kdiff3-0.81_for_KDE3.tar.gz
   - cd into the directory kdiff3-0.81 and type
   - ./configure --prefix=/opt/kde3
   - make
   - make install  (You must have root-rights for this step.)

   For details also see the generic instructions in file "INSTALL".
   
If some icons are not visible or don't seem right, probably the prefix
was wrong. Check where you're KDE2/3 installation is located and
use that directory with the prefix-option of configure.

   
Start from commandline:
- Comparing 2 files:     kdiff3 file1 file2
- Merging 2 files:       kdiff3 file1 file2 -o outputfile
- Comparing 3 files:     kdiff3 file1 file2 file3
- Merging 3 files:       kdiff3 file1 file2 file3 -o outputfile
     Note that file1 will be treated as base of file2 and file3.

If you start without arguments, then a dialog will appear where you can
select your files via a filebrowser.

For more documentation, see the help-menu or the subdirectory doc.

Have fun!
