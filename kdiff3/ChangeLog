Version 0.9.71 - 2003/10/12
===========================
- Windows-Installer by Sebastien Fricker.
- Bugfixes for Windows. (Problems with setFont() in paintEvent().)
- Default font for Windows now "Courier New" (instead of Courier)
- Fix for compilation with gcc 2.95
- Support for Ctrl-Tab under Windows.
- Fix for finding documentation.

Version 0.9.70 - 2003/09/28
===========================
- Transparent access to URLs via KIO (KDE only):
  Compare files and directories on ftp, fish, smb, tar etc. ressources.
- Workaround for a Win32-bug (Crashed sometimes during selections)
- When the merge flag is selected in the open dialog, the directory-tool
  always starts a merge by default for each file. Without the flag only a
  diff will be started by default.
- Immediately showing progress bar in dir scan.
- Showing progress bar for file comparison too.
- Directory-menu: Fold/Unfold all subdirs
- Bugfix for 3-way auto-merge: A line deleted from the base in B and C
  resulted in a empty line instead of being completely removed.
- Improved locale support
- KDiff3 is now a KPart
   - in KDevelop3 it can be used to compare the current text with the
     last saved version, or the current version on disk with the last cvs version.
   - in Konqueror it can be used to look at a unified *.patch-file if one complete
     version is available too.
- Documentation is now in docbook-format.
- "Toggle Split Orientation" for Diff-Input windows. (Good for long lines.)
- When "Dir and Text Split-Screen-View" is off: Now "Focus Next/Prev Window"
  also toggles between dir and text-windows. Selecting a file via double click
  switches to text-screen.
- KDiff3 displays a warning when trying to read a dir without the permission.
- Directory-Diff-Option "Use CVS-Ignore" to ignore files like CVS does.
- Displaying a status message at the end of the directory-comparison.
- Cursor in MergeResultWindow is automatically placed at current difference when a jump occurred.
  (But not when something was selected.)
- Fix for cursor blinking in the topline of the MergeResultWindow.


Version 0.9.61 - 2003/06/07
===========================
- Compilation problem fixed.
- Directory merge: Preserving file attributes and times during copy. (now also for Win32)
- Crash fixed, when directory comparison from the command-line was started.


Version 0.9.60 - 2003/06/01
===========================
New features:
- New ways to select input for the diff window:
  - Pasting clipboard text into a diff window.
  - Drag and drop a file from a filemanager (e.g. konqueror) onto a diff window.
  - Drag and drop text from an editor (e.g. kate) onto a diff window.
  Reanalysis starts immediately if no merge is in progress.
  (This should help you to compare similar parts in the same file.)
- New/Deleted white lines are now also considered as white deltas.
- Configurable keyboard shortcuts for most actions (KDE version only).
- The overview now also distinguishes whitespace deltas.
New preprocessor options:
- You can now define your own external Preprocessor and LineMatchingPreprocessor:
- "Convert to upper case",
- "Ignore numbers"
Fixed bugs:
- Directory merge: Preserving file attributes and times during copy.
  (not for Win32 yet)
Source-tree-structure:
- Switch to KDevelop3 (Gideon): Renamed subdir "kdiff3" to "src".
- xpm-files in xpm-subdirectory.


Version 0.9.51 - 2003/04/14
===========================
- Compilation fix for gcc 2.95.


Version 0.9.50 - 2003/03/30
===========================
Fixed bugs:
- Auto-Advance setting was lost when entering the settings-dialog.
- Windows specific: Keys with AltGr-Combination didn't work.
- Windows 95/98/ME: Fixed crash when KDiff3 is called used without parameters,
  and corrected support for external diff.
New Features:
- Search-function: Search for a string in all open text windows.
- Special background colors for current region.
- Button to toggle showing of whitespace in differences.
- Buttons to go to next/prev unsolved (!) conflict.
- While auto-advance waits, no more choices are allowed.
- New setting: Auto-advance-delay.
  (Note that with delay 0 fast clicks might be detected as double clicks and the second
  click does nothing. My advice: Prefer the keyboard-shortcuts Ctrl-1/2/3)
- Functions to Show/Hide Diff Window A, B or C. The other windows then have more space.
- Merge editor: The right mouse button selects the current region and lets you choose
  A, B or C via a popup menu.
- Commandline option --auto: No GUI if all conflicts are auto-solvable.
- When equal files are compared, then a message box informs you.
- Merge current file: When comparing two or three files, the merge can be started with a single click.
- Option dialog: Warning for "Defaults" added, because it resets all options.
- A warning is given, when the user tries to merge binary files. (i.e. files that contain '\0'-bytes)
Changed behaviour:
- 3 file automerge: When for a line B==C (and A!=B) then C will be selected.
  (In older versions this was a conflict. I was convinced that this is no problem.)
- Auto-Advance now jumps to next unsolved (!) conflict.
- On 256-color-displays KDiff3 uses them. (Previously KDiff3 only used 16 colors.)
- On 16-color-displays the Defaults-button in the options dialog selects special colors.


Version 0.941 - 2003/02/09
==========================
Fixed bugs:
- Qt-only-version: Compile problem corrected.
- Documentation: Formatting for tables corrected.


Version 0.94 - 2003/02/09
=========================
New features:
- Option to use external GNU-diff for line matching.
  (Sometimes GNU-diff is better, sometimes not: You may choose now.)
- In diff-windows a tooltip shows the full path if you move the mouse on the filename.
- Speedup of directory-merge operations without user interaction.
  (Not every item in the tree is made visible anymore. This took too long.)
- When opening a file for comparison or merge KDiff3 immediately shows the first difference.
- "Go To Top/Bottom"-action have been changed to "Go To First/Last Delta".
- Font-Option "Italic For Deltas" added.
- Many icons and actions will only be enabled, when the operation is possible.
- Icon for merge of current file in directory merge mode added.
- New action "Go to Current Delta".
- Conflicts where some lines contained only-white-space-changes are now separated from
  other non-white-space-conflicts.
- Experimental: Use as replacement for ClearCase-cleardiffmrg.exe (under Windows only).
  See main.cpp for details.

Fixed bugs:
- If files were different, but had the same dates, the "not existant"-icon was
  shown for one file. Now a error message will be shown if the option
  "Copy newer instead of merging" is used.
- Documentation: Section "The Operation Column" corrected.
- Qt-only-version: Fontsize wasn't correctly restored.
-                  Keyboard accelerators didn't work for ToggleActions.

- Open-Dialog: Filename specification: If no previous filename is there then start
  directory is taken from another file.
- Message about number of found and automatically solved conflicts.
- Support for wheelmouse based scrolling.
- New option in Diff-tab: Preserve Carriage Return Characters

Fixed bugs:
- Save button disabled until all conflicts are solved.
- Copy-operation conserves conflict messages "<Merge Conflict>".
- Paste operation created pseudo conflicts when the clipboard contained empty lines.
- W95/98/ME specific program crash removed.


Version 0.92 - 2002/11/04
=========================
Severe bug corrected:
- Merge menu: Choose A/B/C Everywhere sometimes lost data. (introduced in 0.9)


Version 0.91 - 2002/11/03

- When comparing two lines, matching spaces often were undetected.
- Merge editor appended extra empty line when saving.
- Sometimes the next diff/conflict wasn't made visible.
- The Auto-Advance setting is saved now.
- When doing a merge the application now has modified-state,
  even without further input. (The old method wasn't safe.)
- File selection now always in directory of respective file.


Version 0.9 - 2002/10/16
========================
New features:
- Qt-only support. Allows compilation under KDE2, Gnome, Mac, Windows, ...
  Note that KDE3 still gets special treatment.
- For Mergers: Auto-Advance after selection, Choose A/B/C everwhere, ...
- Commandline: If files with same name in different directories
  are compared, only the first parameter needs the filename.
- Shift-Del, Ctrl-Ins, Shift-Ins supported for Cut/Copy/Paste

Fixed bugs:
- Make failed on some systems because of missing "minmax.h".
- Files where opened for reading, but not closed afterwards.
- Vertical scrollbar sometimes didn't work correctly.



Version 0.81 - 2002/08/18
=========================
New features:
- Now KDE3 is also supported. Previously only KDE2 was supported.
- Navigation via click into the overview column now supported.

Fixed bugs:
- Some input files caused a crash in the diff-algorithm.
- The meaning of option "Ignore trivial matches" was inverted.
- When selecting a text in one window, this deselects any previously
  active selection in the same or another window.
