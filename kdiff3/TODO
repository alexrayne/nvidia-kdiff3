This file contains some feature-wishes for future KDiff3-versions.

TODO
====
- Overview-option to show only remaining conflicts.
- Colors for disabled and enabled arrow are very similar
- ??? The gutters (kdiff3 have 2 "gutters") fonts and background-foreground colors sholud be configured other
  than the "general" foreground-background colors. Otherwise they are confused with the main dialog.

- Unicode and UTF8 support
- Try to autodetect the line-end-style
- Ignore cvs-keywords like $Revision$
- Correct Christof crash with the Find-function.

- Windows: Check if folders can match case-insensitive.
- Close diff/merge window-menu-action.

- Printing of the diff-windows (requires automatic line wrap)
- Undo function in the merge-editor.
- More viewing options for directory widget.

- And one observation. When select Cyrillic charset - it looks like it was
  not saved. When open this dialog again - Latin charset is selected anyway.
- Add options to specify charset.
- Ask before saving to a file that already exists (optionally).
- Don't overwrite existing .orig-file, when saving the second time.

- File Menu: Close (Ctrl-F4): Close current file (check if saved and forget the data)
- Dirview:
   - Multiselections: Changing Operations or applying ops for all selected items.
   - Optionally show size/date for A/B/C
   - Choose what to see (all or only different items)
   - If only different items are visible: copy the others nevertheless to destdir.
   - Warnung wenn Datum in B oder C �ter als A ist.
   - Zielverzeichnis nachtr�lich �derbar
   - Bei Kopie von Remote nach lokal: Auf jeden Fall das modification Datum setzen.
   - Ctrl-Space doesn't work when a file comparison takes place.
   - Option to allow case-insensitive filename-matching.
- Options to show/suppress annoying messages

- What's this-Help.
- Tip of the day.

More Statistics before the merge begins:
- How many files are there?
- How many files are equal/different?
- How many files would be copies/merged/ignored?

- Allow to view and merge CVS-conflict files (and diff3-output) and allow to save output
  with conflicts in diff3 output-format.
  
- Provide configure-rules for systems without KDE. (I need help here.)

- Allow different comment-styles (e.g. via a regexp for comments)

- Possibility to jump to next difference in the same line (for very long lines).

- Allow analysis of unified directory-diff/patch-file.
